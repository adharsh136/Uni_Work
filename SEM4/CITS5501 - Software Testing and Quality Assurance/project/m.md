Certainly! To involve two characteristics in each test case, we’ll combine both the **State** and **Location** characteristics. This will increase the complexity of the tests and provide broader coverage.

### Question 7: Input Space Partitioning (ISP) for the `LightingCommand` Constructor

The `LightingCommand` constructor is responsible for controlling a light source in a smart home system. We can apply **Input Space Partitioning (ISP)** to test the constructor's behavior by identifying characteristics, defining partitions, and creating meaningful test cases that involve multiple characteristics. For this example, we will focus on the **State** of the light source and the **Location** where the light is located, combining these characteristics in each test case.

#### Step 1: Identifying Characteristics

The `LightingCommand` constructor takes three parameters:
1. **Location**: This represents the physical location of the light (e.g., "living-room", "kitchen"). It can either be a valid `Location` object or `null` if the location is not necessary.
   
2. **Light Source**: This represents the light device being controlled, such as a lamp or bulb, and it must not be `null`.

3. **State**: The `State` parameter is an enumerated value (`ON` or `OFF`) that specifies whether the light should be turned on or off.

#### Step 2: Define Partitions for Two Characteristics: **State** and **Location**

We will create partitions for the **State** of the light and the **Location**. By combining these, we can generate more complex test cases.

##### Characteristic 1: Location
- **Partition 1**: The location is **null**. This is valid when the system can control the light without specifying a particular room.
- **Partition 2**: The location is a valid `Location` object (e.g., `"living-room"`).

##### Characteristic 2: State of the Light
- **Partition 1: `State.ON`**: This indicates that the light should be turned on.
- **Partition 2: `State.OFF`**: This indicates that the light should be turned off.
- **Partition 3: `null`**: This is an invalid state and should raise an exception.

#### Step 3: Define Test Cases Combining **State** and **Location**

Now, we will create test cases that combine the **State** and **Location** characteristics to cover a variety of scenarios.

### Test Case 1: Valid ON State with a Valid Location
- **Test ID**: T1
- **Description**: This test checks if the `LightingCommand` successfully turns on the light when both the `Location` and `State` are valid.
- **Input Values**:
  - **Location**: `new Location("living-room")` (a valid location)
  - **LightSource**: `new LightSource("lamp")` (a valid light source)
  - **State**: `State.ON` (we want to turn the light on)
- **Expected Outcome**: The command should execute successfully, and the light source should be turned on in the specified location.
- **Fixtures**: We create a valid `Location`, `LightSource`, and use the `State.ON` value.
- **Assertions**: We verify that the `LightSource.turnOn()` method is called when the `execute()` method is invoked.

### Test Case 2: Valid OFF State with a Null Location
- **Test ID**: T2
- **Description**: This test checks if the `LightingCommand` can successfully turn off the light when the `Location` is `null` but the `State` is valid.
- **Input Values**:
  - **Location**: `null` (no location is provided)
  - **LightSource**: `new LightSource("bulb")` (a valid light source)
  - **State**: `State.OFF` (we want to turn the light off)
- **Expected Outcome**: The command should execute successfully, and the light source should be turned off. Since the location is `null`, the system should default to the single available light source.
- **Fixtures**: We create a `null` `Location` and a valid `LightSource`, using the `State.OFF` value.
- **Assertions**: We verify that the `LightSource.turnOff()` method is called during execution.

### Test Case 3: Invalid Null State with a Valid Location
- **Test ID**: T3
- **Description**: This test checks if the `LightingCommand` throws an exception when the `State` is `null`, even if the `Location` is valid.
- **Input Values**:
  - **Location**: `new Location("bedroom")` (a valid location)
  - **LightSource**: `new LightSource("neon")` (a valid light source)
  - **State**: `null` (this is an invalid state)
- **Expected Outcome**: The constructor should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` because the `State` is `null`.
- **Fixtures**: We create a valid `Location` and `LightSource`, but pass `null` for the `State`.
- **Assertions**: We check that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown, indicating that the `State` must not be `null`.

### Test Case 4: Valid ON State with a Null Location
- **Test ID**: T4
- **Description**: This test checks if the `LightingCommand` can turn the light on when the `Location` is `null` but the `State` is valid.
- **Input Values**:
  - **Location**: `null` (no location is specified)
  - **LightSource**: `new LightSource("lamp")` (a valid light source)
  - **State**: `State.ON` (we want to turn the light on)
- **Expected Outcome**: The command should execute successfully, and the light source should turn on. The system should handle the `null` location appropriately by defaulting to a single light source.
- **Fixtures**: We create a `null` `Location`, a valid `LightSource`, and use the `State.ON` value.
- **Assertions**: We verify that the `LightSource.turnOn()` method is called.

### Test Case 5: Invalid Null State with a Null Location
- **Test ID**: T5
- **Description**: This test checks if the `LightingCommand` throws an exception when both the `State` and the `Location` are `null`.
- **Input Values**:
  - **Location**: `null`
  - **LightSource**: `new LightSource("lamp")` (a valid light source)
  - **State**: `null` (this is an invalid state)
- **Expected Outcome**: The constructor should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` because the `State` is `null`, regardless of the `Location` being `null`.
- **Fixtures**: We create a `null` `Location`, a valid `LightSource`, and pass `null` for the `State`.
- **Assertions**: We verify that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to the invalid `null` `State`.

### Conclusion

By using **Input Space Partitioning**, we have combined two important characteristics—**Location** and **State**—to create comprehensive test cases for the `LightingCommand` constructor. These test cases cover valid and invalid combinations of `State` and `Location`, ensuring that the constructor behaves as expected under different conditions. This approach gives us broader coverage, catching potential issues such as `null` states and handling of `null` locations, while also ensuring the correct behavior when the light is turned on or off.

This method of combining characteristics allows us to efficiently test multiple important aspects of the constructor, leading to a more robust and well-tested system.
