Understanding and Assumption: My interpretation is that only temperature conditions can be followed after 'when' and only time conditions by 'until' and I think they would sound odd otherwise. For example, "master-bedroom set electric-blanket to 400 K when 10:00 pm" or "master-bedroom set electric-blanket to 400 K until current-temperature less-than 300 K". My assumption is the "<number>" non-terminal that I defined in the non-terminal "<target-temperature>" is the same "<number>" non-terminal present in Domolect 1.7, hence I have not provided its definition.
